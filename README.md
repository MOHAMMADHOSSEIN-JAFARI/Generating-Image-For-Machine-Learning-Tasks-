## Generation of random Voronoi Diagrams
The code is used to generate random Voronoi diagrams. 
The user can determine the charactersitcs of the Voronoi diagram such as:
  1- Number of Images
  2- Number of randomly sampled points
  3- the seed
  4- Width and Heights
Each generated plot is saved as a numpy array. 
The "stored" is a "List" whose elements are a numpy arraies of diagrams.
