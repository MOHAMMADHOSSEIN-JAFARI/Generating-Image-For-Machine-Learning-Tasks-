## General info
* The code can generate a batch of Voronoi images. Each image is a PyTorch tensor with 3 dimensions which are [channel, height, width]. The dimension is [3, height, width] for RGB images, and for grayscale images, it is [1, height, width]
* All images are stored in a PyTorch tensor named image_tensor which has 4 dimensions, which are [batch, channel, height, width].
